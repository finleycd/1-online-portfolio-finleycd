## Self-Reflection:
I tried to finish this project about two hours prior to the 11:59 deadline but I already had a repository. Therefore it couldn't clone the fresh new folder to my old one. 
I ended up finding a way to get it done though.'

I think I deserve an 18/20
### How long it took me to finish this?
About an hour
